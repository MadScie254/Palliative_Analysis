Transcript: PATIENT_002

Interviewer (KNH, Palliative Unit): Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about complementary and alternative medicine use in palliative care. Your responses will remain confidential and help us better understand patient experiences with these therapies.

**Section 1: Demographic Information**

**Interviewer:** How old are you?
**Patient:** I'm 31 years old. (voice clear, youthful energy despite circumstances)

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Male.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I completed university. (slight pride in voice) I have a college degree - studied business administration before all this started.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Neck cancer. (touches neck area reflexively) It's been quite aggressive, and the doctors shifted to palliative care to focus on quality of life rather than cure.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** About seven months now. (thoughtful pause) It feels like much longer sometimes, but then other days it feels like it just happened yesterday.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (nods) My family researched different options and encouraged me to try some complementary approaches alongside my medical treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family mainly. (voice softens) They spent hours researching online, talking to other families, and finding information about what might help with my specific situation.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I've tried massage therapy, which really helps with the tension and stiffness. (shifts position) I've also done acupuncture sessions - that was something I was skeptical about at first but decided to try.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Occasionally. (pauses) Not every day, but maybe twice a week when I can manage it. It depends on how I'm feeling and what my energy levels are like.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective, actually. (voice shows genuine surprise) I wasn't expecting much, to be honest, but both the massage and acupuncture have helped reduce the intensity of the pain, especially the sharp shooting pains I get.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** I'd say they're equally effective. (thoughtful) They work in different ways - the medications handle the baseline pain, but the alternative therapies seem to help with the peaks and the muscle tension that builds up.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** Yes, I have experienced some side effects. (slight grimace) Particularly from the acupuncture sessions.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** The acupuncture caused some pain at the needle insertion sites. (touches various points on body) It wasn't severe, but there was definite discomfort during and sometimes after the sessions. The massage therapy hasn't caused any problems though.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, they have. (voice becomes stronger) Even with the minor side effects, the overall impact has been positive. I feel like I have more good days now.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (emphatic) It's empowering to have options beyond just waiting for the next pain medication dose. I can schedule a massage when I feel tension building up.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (voice confident) I felt it was important to be open about everything I was trying so they could monitor for any interactions or issues.

**Interviewer:** Why?
**Patient:** I wanted my medical team to have the complete picture of my pain management approach. (pauses) I also wanted to make sure nothing I was doing would interfere with my conventional treatments.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not specified in terms of active support, but they didn't discourage me from continuing with the therapies, especially since I was being open about any side effects.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** The main challenge has been the high cost. (sighs) These therapies aren't covered by insurance, and with my reduced income due to illness, it's a real financial strain to maintain regular sessions.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** Recommendations from healthcare providers would definitely help. (voice hopeful) If my doctors actively suggested specific therapies or could refer me to practitioners they trusted, I'd feel more confident about investing more time and money.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, definitely. (voice animated) CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. If these methods can help patients like me manage pain and improve quality of life, they should be part of the standard treatment options.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I'd love to have better access to affordable alternative therapies, maybe through the hospital or as part of a comprehensive pain management program. Also, more guidance on which approaches might work best for my specific type of cancer.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be interested in participating if it could help improve treatment options for other young patients facing similar diagnoses.
