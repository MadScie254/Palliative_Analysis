Transcript: PATIENT_001

Interviewer (KNH, Palliative Unit): Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about complementary and alternative medicine use in palliative care. Your responses will remain confidential and help us better understand patient experiences with these therapies.

**Section 1: Demographic Information**

**Interviewer:** How old are you?
**Patient:** I am 61 years old. (voice steady)

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Female.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I completed secondary school. (pauses) I finished my O-levels but didn't go on to university.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** I have bone cancer. (voice becomes quieter) The doctors told me it's advanced and they're focusing on keeping me comfortable now.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** It's been about eight months now. (sighs softly) Time seems to move differently when you're in this situation.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have tried several different methods. My family encouraged me to explore these options alongside my hospital treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** My family told me about them. (voice warming slightly) My sister especially - she had heard from other families who had been through similar situations. They shared their experiences and what had helped them.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I've tried massage therapy, which helps with the muscle tension. I also use herbal remedies - mostly teas and preparations my sister makes for me. And spiritual practices... (pauses) prayer and meditation have become very important to me.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (nods) Every single day. The massage I try to do myself or with family help, the herbal teas I drink throughout the day, and the spiritual practices have become part of my morning and evening routine.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective, actually. (voice shows surprise) I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but they really do help. The massage eases the constant aching in my bones, and the herbal teas seem to calm my whole system.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** I'd say they're equally effective. (thoughtful pause) The hospital medicines are crucial - don't get me wrong - but these methods work alongside them really well. They complement each other.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from the alternative methods I use.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - I haven't had any side effects to explain.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, definitely. (voice becomes stronger) I feel more like myself when I use these methods. They give me something to do for myself, some control over how I feel day to day.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (emphatic) Instead of just waiting for the next dose of medication, I can actively do something when the pain starts building. That psychological difference is huge.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** No, I haven't brought it up with my doctors or nurses. (voice becomes hesitant)

**Interviewer:** Why not?
**Patient:** I'm afraid they might disapprove or tell me to stop. (long pause) I worry they might think I'm being foolish or that I don't trust their treatment. I don't want to upset the relationship we have.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** I haven't given them the opportunity to show support or disapproval because I haven't told them about it.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Not specified in my particular case - I've been fortunate that my family helps with everything and we haven't encountered major barriers.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** If I had recommendations from healthcare providers, I would feel much more confident about using these methods. (voice brightens) If the doctors said it was okay or even encouraged it, I could relax and focus on the benefits.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, I really do. (voice becomes animated) CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. These methods have helped me so much, and I think other patients could benefit too if they were offered as part of the standard treatment plan.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would love to have proper guidance on which alternative methods might work best for my specific type of cancer and pain. (pauses) Maybe some training on how to do massage techniques properly, or which herbal remedies are safest to use.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be willing to participate if it could help other patients in similar situations. (voice firm) If sharing my experience could help improve care for others, I think that would be meaningful.

Interview concluded. Patient appeared comfortable throughout the discussion and was forthcoming about her experiences with both conventional and alternative therapies.

Transcript: PATIENT_002

Interviewer (KNH, Palliative Unit): Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about complementary and alternative medicine use in palliative care. Your responses will remain confidential and help us better understand patient experiences with these therapies.

**Section 1: Demographic Information**

**Interviewer:** How old are you?
**Patient:** I'm 31 years old. (voice clear, youthful energy despite circumstances)

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Male.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I completed university. (slight pride in voice) I have a college degree - studied business administration before all this started.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Neck cancer. (touches neck area reflexively) It's been quite aggressive, and the doctors shifted to palliative care to focus on quality of life rather than cure.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** About seven months now. (thoughtful pause) It feels like much longer sometimes, but then other days it feels like it just happened yesterday.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (nods) My family researched different options and encouraged me to try some complementary approaches alongside my medical treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family mainly. (voice softens) They spent hours researching online, talking to other families, and finding information about what might help with my specific situation.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I've tried massage therapy, which really helps with the tension and stiffness. (shifts position) I've also done acupuncture sessions - that was something I was skeptical about at first but decided to try.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Occasionally. (pauses) Not every day, but maybe twice a week when I can manage it. It depends on how I'm feeling and what my energy levels are like.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective, actually. (voice shows genuine surprise) I wasn't expecting much, to be honest, but both the massage and acupuncture have helped reduce the intensity of the pain, especially the sharp shooting pains I get.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** I'd say they're equally effective. (thoughtful) They work in different ways - the medications handle the baseline pain, but the alternative therapies seem to help with the peaks and the muscle tension that builds up.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** Yes, I have experienced some side effects. (slight grimace) Particularly from the acupuncture sessions.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** The acupuncture caused some pain at the needle insertion sites. (touches various points on body) It wasn't severe, but there was definite discomfort during and sometimes after the sessions. The massage therapy hasn't caused any problems though.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, they have. (voice becomes stronger) Even with the minor side effects, the overall impact has been positive. I feel like I have more good days now.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (emphatic) It's empowering to have options beyond just waiting for the next pain medication dose. I can schedule a massage when I feel tension building up.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (voice confident) I felt it was important to be open about everything I was trying so they could monitor for any interactions or issues.

**Interviewer:** Why?
**Patient:** I wanted my medical team to have the complete picture of my pain management approach. (pauses) I also wanted to make sure nothing I was doing would interfere with my conventional treatments.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not specified in terms of active support, but they didn't discourage me from continuing with the therapies, especially since I was being open about any side effects.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** The main challenge has been the high cost. (sighs) These therapies aren't covered by insurance, and with my reduced income due to illness, it's a real financial strain to maintain regular sessions.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** Recommendations from healthcare providers would definitely help. (voice hopeful) If my doctors actively suggested specific therapies or could refer me to practitioners they trusted, I'd feel more confident about investing more time and money.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, definitely. (voice animated) CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. If these methods can help patients like me manage pain and improve quality of life, they should be part of the standard treatment options.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I'd love to have better access to affordable alternative therapies, maybe through the hospital or as part of a comprehensive pain management program. Also, more guidance on which approaches might work best for my specific type of cancer.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be interested in participating if it could help improve treatment options for other young patients facing similar diagnoses.

Interview concluded. Patient appeared engaged throughout the discussion and was particularly articulate about both the benefits and challenges of integrating alternative therapies into conventional care.
