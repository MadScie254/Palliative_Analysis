Interviewer (KNH, Palliative Unit): Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about complementary and alternative medicine use in palliative care. Your responses will remain confidential and help us better understand patient experiences with these therapies.

**Section 1: Demographic Information**

**Interviewer:** How old are you?
**Patient:** I am 61 years old. (voice steady)

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Female.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I completed secondary school. (pauses) I finished my O-levels but didn't go on to university.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** I have bone cancer. (voice becomes quieter) The doctors told me it's advanced and they're focusing on keeping me comfortable now.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** It's been about eight months now. (sighs softly) Time seems to move differently when you're in this situation.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have tried several different methods. My family encouraged me to explore these options alongside my hospital treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** My family told me about them. (voice warming slightly) My sister especially - she had heard from other families who had been through similar situations. They shared their experiences and what had helped them.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I've tried massage therapy, which helps with the muscle tension. I also use herbal remedies - mostly teas and preparations my sister makes for me. And spiritual practices... (pauses) prayer and meditation have become very important to me.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (nods) Every single day. The massage I try to do myself or with family help, the herbal teas I drink throughout the day, and the spiritual practices have become part of my morning and evening routine.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective, actually. (voice shows surprise) I wasn't sure what to expect at first, but they really do help. The massage eases the constant aching in my bones, and the herbal teas seem to calm my whole system.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** I'd say they're equally effective. (thoughtful pause) The hospital medicines are crucial - don't get me wrong - but these methods work alongside them really well. They complement each other.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from the alternative methods I use.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - I haven't had any side effects to explain.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, definitely. (voice becomes stronger) I feel more like myself when I use these methods. They give me something to do for myself, some control over how I feel day to day.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (emphatic) Instead of just waiting for the next dose of medication, I can actively do something when the pain starts building. That psychological difference is huge.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** No, I haven't brought it up with my doctors or nurses. (voice becomes hesitant)

**Interviewer:** Why not?
**Patient:** I'm afraid they might disapprove or tell me to stop. (long pause) I worry they might think I'm being foolish or that I don't trust their treatment. I don't want to upset the relationship we have.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** I haven't given them the opportunity to show support or disapproval because I haven't told them about it.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Not specified in my particular case - I've been fortunate that my family helps with everything and we haven't encountered major barriers.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** If I had recommendations from healthcare providers, I would feel much more confident about using these methods. (voice brightens) If the doctors said it was okay or even encouraged it, I could relax and focus on the benefits.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, I really do. (voice becomes animated) CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. These methods have helped me so much, and I think other patients could benefit too if they were offered as part of the standard treatment plan.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would love to have proper guidance on which alternative methods might work best for my specific type of cancer and pain. (pauses) Maybe some training on how to do massage techniques properly, or which herbal remedies are safest to use.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be willing to participate if it could help other patients in similar situations. (voice firm) If sharing my experience could help improve care for others, I think that would be meaningful.

Transcript: PATIENT_002

Interviewer (KNH, Palliative Unit): Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about complementary and alternative medicine use in palliative care. Your responses will remain confidential and help us better understand patient experiences with these therapies.

**Section 1: Demographic Information**

**Interviewer:** How old are you?
**Patient:** I'm 31 years old. (voice clear, youthful energy despite circumstances)

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Male.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I completed university. (slight pride in voice) I have a college degree - studied business administration before all this started.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Neck cancer. (touches neck area reflexively) It's been quite aggressive, and the doctors shifted to palliative care to focus on quality of life rather than cure.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** About seven months now. (thoughtful pause) It feels like much longer sometimes, but then other days it feels like it just happened yesterday.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (nods) My family researched different options and encouraged me to try some complementary approaches alongside my medical treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family mainly. (voice softens) They spent hours researching online, talking to other families, and finding information about what might help with my specific situation.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I've tried massage therapy, which really helps with the tension and stiffness. (shifts position) I've also done acupuncture sessions - that was something I was skeptical about at first but decided to try.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Occasionally. (pauses) Not every day, but maybe twice a week when I can manage it. It depends on how I'm feeling and what my energy levels are like.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective, actually. (voice shows genuine surprise) I wasn't expecting much, to be honest, but both the massage and acupuncture have helped reduce the intensity of the pain, especially the sharp shooting pains I get.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** I'd say they're equally effective. (thoughtful) They work in different ways - the medications handle the baseline pain, but the alternative therapies seem to help with the peaks and the muscle tension that builds up.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** Yes, I have experienced some side effects. (slight grimace) Particularly from the acupuncture sessions.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** The acupuncture caused some pain at the needle insertion sites. (touches various points on body) It wasn't severe, but there was definite discomfort during and sometimes after the sessions. The massage therapy hasn't caused any problems though.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, they have. (voice becomes stronger) Even with the minor side effects, the overall impact has been positive. I feel like I have more good days now.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (emphatic) It's empowering to have options beyond just waiting for the next pain medication dose. I can schedule a massage when I feel tension building up.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (voice confident) I felt it was important to be open about everything I was trying so they could monitor for any interactions or issues.

**Interviewer:** Why?
**Patient:** I wanted my medical team to have the complete picture of my pain management approach. (pauses) I also wanted to make sure nothing I was doing would interfere with my conventional treatments.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not specified in terms of active support, but they didn't discourage me from continuing with the therapies, especially since I was being open about any side effects.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** The main challenge has been the high cost. (sighs) These therapies aren't covered by insurance, and with my reduced income due to illness, it's a real financial strain to maintain regular sessions.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** Recommendations from healthcare providers would definitely help. (voice hopeful) If my doctors actively suggested specific therapies or could refer me to practitioners they trusted, I'd feel more confident about investing more time and money.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, definitely. (voice animated) CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. If these methods can help patients like me manage pain and improve quality of life, they should be part of the standard treatment options.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I'd love to have better access to affordable alternative therapies, maybe through the hospital or as part of a comprehensive pain management program. Also, more guidance on which approaches might work best for my specific type of cancer.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be interested in participating if it could help improve treatment options for other young patients facing similar diagnoses.

Interviewer (KNH, Palliative Unit): Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about complementary and alternative medicine use in palliative care. Your responses will remain confidential and help us better understand patient experiences with these therapies.

**Section 1: Demographic Information**

**Interviewer:** How old are you?
**Patient:** I am 71 years old. (voice calm, measured)

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Male.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I completed secondary school. (pauses) Did my O-levels and worked for many years before retirement.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Stomach cancer. (voice becomes quieter) It's advanced now, and the doctors say the focus should be on comfort and managing symptoms rather than aggressive treatments.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** About eight months now. (thoughtful) It's been a journey of learning to live differently, focusing on what makes each day better.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (nods slowly) I've found that combining different approaches helps me manage better than relying on conventional medicine alone.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my nutritionist, actually. (voice brightens slightly) When I was first diagnosed, I was referred to a nutritionist to help with eating difficulties, and she introduced me to broader concepts about anti-inflammatory approaches.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I focus mainly on anti-inflammatory foods. (voice becomes more animated) I've changed my entire diet to include foods that are supposed to reduce inflammation in the body - things like turmeric, ginger, leafy greens, fish high in omega-3s.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (emphatic) Every meal is planned around these principles now. It's become a way of life rather than just a treatment - I think about every food choice in terms of whether it will help or hurt.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective. (voice shows conviction) I notice a real difference in my overall comfort level and energy when I stick strictly to the anti-inflammatory diet versus when I slip back to old eating habits.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** More effective than conventional medicines alone. (pause for emphasis) The medications help with acute pain, but the dietary approach seems to address underlying inflammation that contributes to my discomfort throughout the day.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from the dietary changes I've made.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - the dietary approach has only had positive effects on my overall well-being.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, significantly. (voice becomes stronger) I feel more energetic, my digestion has improved, and I have a sense of actively participating in my care rather than being passive.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (confident tone) Every meal is a choice I can make to either help or hinder my comfort. That sense of control is psychologically very important when so much else feels out of my hands.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (matter-of-fact tone) I believe in being completely open with my medical team about everything I'm doing for my health.

**Interviewer:** Why?
**Patient:** I want them to understand the full picture of my approach to managing my condition. (pauses) Also, I wanted to make sure there weren't any foods that might interfere with my medications or treatment.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not specified in terms of active encouragement, but they haven't discouraged the dietary approach and seem pleased that I'm taking an active role in my care.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Limited availability has been the main challenge. (sighs) Finding high-quality anti-inflammatory foods consistently, especially fresh items, can be difficult depending on the season and what's available in local markets.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** Recommendations from healthcare providers would be very helpful. (voice hopeful) If my doctors actively supported specific dietary approaches or could connect me with specialists who understand both nutrition and cancer care.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, definitely. (voice firm) CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. Dietary approaches especially should be part of standard care - nutrition affects everything about how we feel and heal.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would appreciate having access to a nutritionist who specializes in cancer and palliative care, someone who could provide ongoing guidance as my condition changes and my needs evolve.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be very interested in participating, particularly if the research focused on nutritional approaches to symptom management in palliative care.

**Patient:** Sinus cancer. (touches face area gently) It affects my breathing and causes a lot of facial pain and pressure.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** It's been almost two years now. (sighs) It feels like a very long time when you're dealing with constant discomfort.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have tried some things. (hesitant) My friends suggested I try some natural remedies to see if they might help.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through friends mainly. (voice becomes slightly warmer) Some of the other women in my community had heard about herbal remedies that might help with pain and breathing difficulties.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I've tried herbal remedies. (pauses) Mostly teas and preparations that are supposed to help with inflammation and pain. My friends helped me find different herbs that might be good for sinus problems.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. I make herbal teas every morning and evening. (voice becomes matter-of-fact) It's become part of my routine, even though I'm not sure how much it helps.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Not effective at all, honestly. (voice becomes flat) I was hoping they would help, but I don't notice any real difference in my pain levels or breathing.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?

**Patient:** I haven't given them the opportunity to show support or disapproval since I haven't brought it up.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Limited availability and high cost have been problems. (voice becomes strained) It's hard to find good quality herbs consistently, and even though they're not helping much, they're expensive for someone in my situation.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** More research and proven effectiveness would help. (voice shows some hope) If there were studies showing that certain herbal treatments actually work for sinus cancer symptoms, I might be more motivated to continue trying.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** I'm not sure. (uncertain tone) Since they haven't helped me personally, I'm not convinced they should be part of standard care, but maybe they work for other people.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would like better options for managing the facial pain and breathing difficulties. Maybe different medications or treatments that are specifically designed for sinus cancer symptoms.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?

**Patient:** Female.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I completed secondary school. (pauses) Finished my O-levels and worked as a clerk for many years.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Cancer. (voice becomes quieter) The doctors haven't gone into all the specific details, but they've moved me to comfort care.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** Less than six months. (thoughtful) It's still quite new for me - I'm still learning what this means for my daily life.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have tried aromatherapy. (voice becomes slightly more animated) My family suggested it might help with relaxation and stress management.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family. (soft smile in voice) My daughter had read about aromatherapy being used for cancer patients and thought it might be worth trying for relaxation and possibly pain relief.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** Aromatherapy - using essential oils in a diffuser and sometimes applying diluted oils to my skin. (pauses) I use different scents depending on whether I'm trying to relax or energize myself.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Weekly. (matter-of-fact tone) Usually I set aside time on weekends to have longer aromatherapy sessions, though sometimes I use the diffuser more frequently during particularly stressful periods.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Not effective at all for pain control. (honest, direct tone) While the scents are pleasant and relaxing, they don't actually reduce my physical pain levels.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** Less effective than conventional medicines. (pragmatic tone) The hospital medications actually manage my pain, while the aromatherapy is more about creating a pleasant environment.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from the aromatherapy.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - the aromatherapy has been gentle with no adverse reactions.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** No, not significantly. (realistic tone) While I enjoy the relaxing aspects, it hasn't made a meaningful difference in my overall well-being or daily functioning.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** No, I don't feel more control over my pain. (matter-of-fact) The aromatherapy helps me feel calmer, but it doesn't give me any real control over my physical symptoms.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** No, I haven't brought it up with my medical team.

**Interviewer:** Why not?
**Patient:** I didn't think it was necessary to mention. (practical tone) Since it's not really helping with medical symptoms and is more about creating a pleasant atmosphere, I didn't see it as medically relevant.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not applicable since I haven't discussed it with them.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Limited availability has been an issue. (slight frustration in voice) Finding good quality essential oils consistently can be challenging, and some of the specific scents that work best for me aren't always available.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** More research and proven effectiveness would be important. (thoughtful) If there were studies showing that aromatherapy actually provides medical benefits for cancer patients, I might approach it more systematically.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, I think CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. (voice becomes more animated) Even if aromatherapy doesn't directly treat symptoms, if it helps some patients feel more comfortable in the hospital environment, that seems worthwhile.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would appreciate more effective conventional pain management options and perhaps guidance on which alternative approaches might actually provide medical benefits rather than just comfort.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be willing to participate if it could help determine which approaches are truly beneficial for patients like me.

**Patient:** Breast cancer. (voice becomes more serious) It's advanced now, and we're focusing on managing symptoms and maintaining quality of life.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** About a year and a half now. (reflective tone) It's been a journey of learning to adapt and find new ways to manage daily challenges.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (confident tone) My family encouraged me to explore complementary approaches alongside my medical treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family mainly. (voice warms) They researched different options and connected me with other women who had experience with breast cancer and alternative therapies.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I use herbal remedies regularly. (animated) I prepare teas and take herbal supplements that are supposed to help with inflammation, nausea, and general well-being. My sister helps me research which herbs might be most beneficial.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (emphatic) I've incorporated herbal teas into my morning and evening routine, and I take herbal supplements with my meals. It's become an important part of how I care for myself.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective. (voice shows conviction) I notice a real difference in my pain levels and overall comfort when I'm consistent with my herbal routine compared to when I skip it.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** Less effective than conventional medicines for acute pain. (thoughtful) But they seem to work well for overall comfort and helping me feel more balanced. The conventional medications are stronger, but the herbs help with things the medications don't address.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from the herbal remedies I use.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - the herbs have been gentle on my system without causing any problems.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, definitely. (voice becomes stronger) I feel more energetic and have better days overall when I'm consistent with my herbal routine. It gives me a sense of actively participating in my care.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (emphatic) Having something I can do actively for myself, rather than just taking prescribed medications, makes me feel less helpless in managing my condition.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** No, I haven't brought it up with my medical team. (voice becomes hesitant)

**Interviewer:** Why not?
**Patient:** I don't think it's necessary to mention it. (pauses) The herbal remedies don't seem to interfere with my medical treatments, and I figure what I do at home for comfort is my own business.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Since I haven't discussed it with them, I don't know what their position would be.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** High cost is the main barrier. (sighs) Quality herbal supplements and teas can be expensive, and with reduced income due to my illness, it's sometimes difficult to maintain the routine I'd like.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** Low cost options would make the biggest difference. (voice hopeful) If there were more affordable sources for quality herbs, or if insurance covered some alternative therapies, I could be more consistent.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, I really believe CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. (voice becomes animated) These approaches can complement conventional treatment and help patients feel more in control of their healing process.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would love to have access to knowledgeable practitioners who could guide me in choosing the most effective herbs for my specific symptoms, and maybe help with cost-effective sources.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be very interested in participating if it could help other women facing similar challenges with breast cancer.

Interviewer (KNH, Palliative Unit): Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research study about complementary and alternative medicine use in palliative care. Your responses will remain confidential and help us better understand patient experiences with these therapies.

**Section 1: Demographic Information**

**Interviewer:** How old are you?
**Patient:** I'm 32 years old. (voice young but weary)

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Female.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I have a university degree. (pause) I studied psychology before this all started. It's helped me understand some of the emotional aspects of dealing with serious illness.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Limb cancer. (touches affected area reflexively) It's in my leg, and the focus has shifted to managing symptoms and maintaining as much mobility as possible.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** Less than six months. (thoughtful) It's still new territory for me - I'm learning what this means for my future and daily life.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have tried massage therapy. (voice shows some relief) My family suggested it might help with both the physical discomfort and the emotional stress.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family. (voice softens) They've been incredibly supportive and researched different approaches that might complement my medical treatment. They found a massage therapist who has experience working with cancer patients.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** Massage therapy specifically. (becomes more animated) It's therapeutic massage focused on areas that aren't directly affected by the cancer, to help with overall tension and circulation.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Weekly. (matter-of-fact) I try to schedule a session every week, though sometimes my energy levels or treatment schedule makes that difficult to maintain consistently.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Somewhat effective. (thoughtful tone) The massage doesn't eliminate the pain from the cancer itself, but it does help with the muscle tension and stiffness that builds up from compensating for the affected limb.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** Less effective than conventional medicines for direct pain control. (realistic assessment) The medications handle the intense pain, but the massage helps with secondary discomfort and stress relief that the medicines don't address.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from the massage therapy.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - the massage has been gentle and appropriate for my condition without causing any problems.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, they have. (voice becomes more positive) The massage sessions give me something to look forward to, and I feel more relaxed and less tense afterward. It's as much about emotional well-being as physical comfort.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, to some degree. (thoughtful) While I can't control the cancer pain directly, being able to address the secondary tension and stress gives me a sense of actively managing part of my situation.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** Yes, I have. (confident tone) I believe in being completely open with my medical team about everything I'm doing for my health.

**Interviewer:** Why?
**Patient:** I want them to have the full picture of my pain management approach. (pauses) Also, with my psychology background, I understand the importance of integrated care and communication between all aspects of treatment.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not specified in terms of active encouragement, but they didn't discourage it and seemed pleased that I was taking a proactive approach to managing stress and secondary symptoms.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Lack of provider support and skepticism from family and friends have been challenges. (voice shows frustration) While my immediate family is supportive, some extended family and friends question whether it's worth the time and money, especially when conventional treatment is the priority.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** More availability in hospitals would be ideal. (voice becomes hopeful) If massage therapy or other complementary approaches were available as part of the hospital's palliative care services, it would be much easier to access regularly.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (voice animated) CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. These approaches address aspects of patient well-being that conventional medicine sometimes overlooks - the psychological and comfort aspects are just as important as the medical treatment.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would love to see complementary therapies offered within the hospital setting, with therapists who understand cancer and palliative care. Also, better integration between conventional and alternative approaches.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be very interested in participating, especially if the research focuses on the psychological benefits of complementary approaches for young adults facing serious illness.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** I use herbal remedies - mainly teas that are supposed to help with throat discomfort and inflammation. (pauses) And prayers have become very important to me. I spend time in prayer daily, asking for strength and comfort.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Occasionally. (reflective) The herbal teas when my throat is particularly uncomfortable, and prayer is more regular - usually morning and evening, and whenever I feel the need for spiritual comfort.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective. (voice shows conviction) The herbal teas do seem to ease some of the throat irritation, and the prayer... (pauses) the prayer gives me a different kind of comfort that helps me cope with the pain emotionally.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** I'm not sure how to compare them directly. (thoughtful tone) The hospital medicines work on the physical symptoms, but the herbal teas and prayer address something deeper - they help me feel more at peace with my situation.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from either the herbal teas or the prayer practices.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - both approaches have been gentle and only brought comfort without any adverse effects.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, they have. (voice becomes stronger) Especially the prayer - it helps me feel less anxious and more accepting of my situation. The herbal teas provide some physical relief too.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, I do. (emphatic) Being able to turn to prayer when I'm struggling gives me a sense of agency. And preparing the herbal teas is something active I can do for myself.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Limited availability and high cost have been issues. (voice shows frustration) Finding good quality herbs consistently is difficult, and the costs add up when you're already dealing with medical expenses and reduced income.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** More research and proven effectiveness would be helpful. (thoughtful) If there were studies showing which herbal approaches actually work for throat cancer symptoms, I could make better choices about what to invest in.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, I believe CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. (voice firm) If these approaches can provide comfort and help patients cope better, they should be available as part of comprehensive care.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would appreciate guidance on which herbal remedies are most effective and safe for throat cancer patients, and perhaps access to spiritual counseling as part of the hospital services.

**Patient:** Yes, I have tried herbal remedies. (nods slowly) My family encouraged me to try natural approaches that might help with the throat discomfort.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family mainly. (voice warms) My children and grandchildren researched different herbal remedies that might help with throat cancer symptoms and general well-being.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** Herbal remedies - mostly teas and preparations made from local herbs that are supposed to help with inflammation and throat comfort. (pauses) My agricultural background helps me understand which plants might be beneficial.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (matter-of-fact) I prepare herbal teas every morning and evening. At my age, routines become very important, and this has become part of how I care for myself.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective. (voice shows satisfaction) The herbal preparations do seem to ease the throat irritation and provide some comfort that complements my medical treatments.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?

**Patient:** I have a college degree. (pause) I studied computer science and worked in IT before my diagnosis changed everything.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Lung cancer. (voice becomes quieter, occasional cough) It's advanced and affects my breathing significantly. The focus now is on managing symptoms rather than cure.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** About a year and a half. (reflective, tired tone) It's been a long journey of adjusting expectations and learning to cope with declining function.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have tried herbal remedies. (hesitant tone) My family encouraged me to explore natural options that might help complement my medical treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family. (voice flat) They researched different herbal approaches online and through community networks, hoping to find something that might help with my symptoms.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** Herbal remedies mainly - teas and supplements that were supposed to help with breathing, reduce inflammation, or boost energy. (pauses, coughs slightly) I tried various preparations over several months.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (matter-of-fact tone) I was taking herbal supplements with meals and drinking specialized teas throughout the day, hoping they would make some difference in how I felt.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** No, they haven't improved my quality of life. (direct, honest tone) If anything, the side effects made some days worse, and the disappointment of them not working was emotionally difficult.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** No, I don't feel more in control. (voice shows frustration) The lack of effectiveness and the side effects made me feel like I was wasting time and energy on approaches that weren't helping my situation.

**Patient:** No, I didn't mention it to my medical team. (defensive tone)

**Interviewer:** Why not?

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not applicable since I haven't discussed alternative therapies with them.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** None in terms of access - my main challenge was that the treatments simply didn't work for me despite having no barriers to trying them.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** More research and proven effectiveness would be essential. (voice firm) I would need to see solid scientific evidence that specific treatments actually work for lung cancer symptoms before I would consider trying alternative approaches again.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** No, I don't think they should be integrated into mainstream care. (definitive tone) Based on my experience, I'm skeptical about their effectiveness, and I worry that including unproven treatments might give patients false hope or delay effective care.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would prefer to focus on improving the conventional treatments available - better pain medications, more effective symptom management, and clearer information about what treatments have solid evidence behind them.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?

**Interviewer:** What is your gender?
**Patient:** Female.

**Interviewer:** What is your level of education?
**Patient:** I have a college degree. (slight pride) I studied nursing and worked in hospitals for over thirty years before retirement.

**Interviewer:** What is your main diagnosis for palliative care?
**Patient:** Cervical cancer. (voice becomes more serious) At my age and with the extent of the disease, the doctors decided palliative care was the most appropriate approach for maintaining comfort.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** About eight months now. (thoughtful) Having worked in hospitals my whole career, I understand what this transition means and what to expect.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have used herbal remedies. (confident tone) My nursing background makes me cautious, but my family convinced me to try some gentle approaches alongside my medical treatment.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family mainly. (voice warms) My daughter and granddaughters researched herbal approaches that might help with the specific symptoms I'm experiencing from cervical cancer.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** Herbal remedies - primarily teas and gentle preparations that are supposed to help with inflammation and general comfort. (pauses) My nursing knowledge helps me choose approaches that seem safest.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (matter-of-fact) I prepare herbal teas as part of my morning and evening routine. At my age, having comforting rituals is important for maintaining structure and dignity.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Somewhat effective. (measured tone) The herbal preparations provide mild comfort and seem to help with some of the general discomfort, though they're not strong enough for severe pain episodes.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** Less effective than conventional medicines for actual pain control. (professional assessment) But they provide a different kind of comfort - more emotional and psychological support than direct symptom relief.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any adverse effects from the herbal preparations I use. (confident) My nursing background helps me choose gentle approaches and monitor for any problems.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - I've been careful to select mild herbal preparations that don't cause any negative reactions.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, they have improved my quality of life. (voice becomes warmer) Not necessarily through direct symptom relief, but by giving me something positive to focus on and a sense of participating actively in my care.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, I do feel more control. (emphatic) As a nurse, I know how important it is for patients to feel they can do something for themselves rather than being completely dependent on others for care.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** No, I haven't brought it up with my current medical team. (hesitant)

**Interviewer:** Why not?
**Patient:** The provider never asked about it specifically. (pauses) And since I'm using very mild preparations and monitoring myself carefully with my nursing knowledge, I didn't think it was necessary to mention unless directly asked.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Since I haven't discussed it with them, I don't know what their position would be on complementary approaches.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Lack of healthcare provider support and high cost are the main barriers. (voice shows mild frustration) It would be helpful if the medical team actively asked about and supported safe complementary approaches, and the costs do add up on a fixed retirement income.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** More research and proven effectiveness would be very important. (professional tone) As a nurse, I believe in evidence-based practice, so having scientific studies about which herbal approaches actually work would help me make better decisions.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, I believe CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. (voice becomes animated) From my nursing experience, I know that patient comfort involves more than just medical treatment - gentle complementary approaches can address psychological and spiritual needs too.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would appreciate having healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about safe complementary approaches and can provide professional guidance on what might be appropriate for elderly patients with my specific condition.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?

**Patient:** Sinus cancer. (touches face area gently) It affects my breathing and causes significant facial pain and pressure, similar to what some other patients here experience.

**Interviewer:** How long have you been receiving palliative care?
**Patient:** Less than six months. (thoughtful) It's still relatively new for me - I'm learning to adapt to this approach to managing my condition.

**Section 2: Awareness and Use**

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any type of alternative therapy or method for pain management?
**Patient:** Yes, I have tried aromatherapy. (voice brightens slightly) My family suggested it might help with both the physical discomfort and the stress of dealing with cancer.

**Interviewer:** How did you learn about these options?
**Patient:** Through my family. (voice warms) They researched different approaches that might complement my medical treatment and found that aromatherapy has been used to help cancer patients with relaxation and symptom management.

**Interviewer:** Which of these methods have you tried?
**Patient:** Aromatherapy using essential oils - both in diffusers and applied topically in diluted form. (becomes more animated) I use different scents depending on whether I'm trying to ease sinus pressure, relax, or energize myself.

**Interviewer:** How often do you use these methods?
**Patient:** Daily. (emphatic) I use aromatherapy every day, sometimes multiple times depending on my symptoms and stress levels. It's become an important part of my self-care routine.

**Section 3: Effectiveness and Satisfaction**

**Interviewer:** How effective have they been in controlling your pain?
**Patient:** Very effective. (voice shows conviction) The aromatherapy really does seem to help with the sinus pressure and facial pain. Certain oils like eucalyptus help me breathe easier, and lavender helps with overall relaxation.

**Interviewer:** Compared to hospital medicines, how would you rate these alternative therapies?
**Patient:** Equally effective. (thoughtful tone) They work differently than my medications - the medicines handle the intense pain, but the aromatherapy provides ongoing comfort throughout the day and helps prevent stress from making my symptoms worse.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever experienced any side effects from these therapies?
**Patient:** No, I haven't experienced any negative side effects from aromatherapy.

**Interviewer:** Please explain those side effects.
**Patient:** Not applicable - the essential oils have been gentle and haven't caused any adverse reactions when used properly.

**Interviewer:** Have these treatments improved your overall quality of life?
**Patient:** Yes, significantly. (voice becomes stronger) The aromatherapy helps me feel more comfortable throughout the day and gives me tools to manage both physical symptoms and emotional stress.

**Interviewer:** Do you feel you have more control over your pain because of these methods?
**Patient:** Yes, absolutely. (emphatic) Being able to choose different oils based on how I'm feeling and what symptoms I'm experiencing gives me an active role in managing my comfort hour by hour.

**Section 4: Communication and Decision-Making**

**Interviewer:** Have you discussed your use of alternative therapy with your healthcare provider?
**Patient:** Yes, I have mentioned it to my medical team. (confident tone) I believe in being completely open about all aspects of my care approach.

**Interviewer:** Why?
**Patient:** I want my healthcare providers to understand the full picture of how I'm managing my condition. (pauses) Also, I wanted to make sure there were no concerns about using essential oils with my particular type of cancer or medications.

**Interviewer:** Has the healthcare provider shown support?
**Patient:** Not specified in terms of active encouragement, but they seemed pleased that I was taking proactive steps to manage stress and symptoms, and they didn't raise any concerns about the aromatherapy approach.

**Section 5: Barriers and Challenges**

**Interviewer:** What challenges have you faced?
**Patient:** Limited availability has been the main challenge. (slight frustration in voice) Finding high-quality essential oils consistently, especially specific blends that work best for sinus-related symptoms, can be difficult depending on what local suppliers have in stock.

**Interviewer:** What would motivate you to use them more regularly?
**Patient:** More research and proven effectiveness would be helpful. (thoughtful) While I'm convinced of the benefits from my own experience, having scientific studies about which essential oils work best for specific cancer symptoms would help me optimize my approach.

**Section 6: Final Thoughts**

**Interviewer:** Do you believe alternative therapies should be officially included in conventional care?
**Patient:** Yes, I strongly believe CAM should be integrated into mainstream palliative care. (voice becomes animated) Aromatherapy and other gentle approaches can provide real comfort and empowerment for patients without interfering with conventional treatment.

**Interviewer:** What additional support would you like to receive regarding pain management?
**Patient:** I would love to have access to practitioners who specialize in using aromatherapy for cancer patients, and perhaps guidance on creating personalized blends for specific symptoms that sinus cancer patients experience.

**Interviewer:** Would you like to participate in future research?
**Patient:** Yes, I would be very interested in participating, especially if the research focuses on how specific essential oils can be used effectively for sinus cancer symptoms and stress management.
